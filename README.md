# Custom firmware for my Anycubic I3 MEGA

Use this firmware at your own risk. Even if uploading back the original firmware is not difficult, I do not think that changing the firmware to a working printer is a good idea if you don't know exactly what you are doing.

## Anycubic I3 Mega

The Anycubic i3 Mega is a solid, metal-framed 3D printer that comes mostly assembled. Assembly is easy and takes only a few minutes. It is capable of producing high quality prints. Stable construction and fine layer resolution down to 0.05 mm. It supports multiple filament materials, including PLA, ABS, High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) and wood.
