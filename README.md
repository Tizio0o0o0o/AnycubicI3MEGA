# Custom firmware for Anycubic I3 MEGA

This repository houses original and custom firmware for the Anycubic i3 Mega 3D printer. The custom one is based on Marlin, a popular open-source firmware for 3D printers. It has been modified to improve print quality, stability, user experience and <strong>to be adapted to my modified printer needs</strong>.

## Anycubic i3 Mega

The Anycubic i3 Mega is a popular FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer that is known for its high quality prints, ease of use, and affordable price. It is a great choice for beginners and experienced users alike. The stock firmware is ok, but modifying it will improve a lot the printer capabilities and safety.

## :bangbang: Disclamer :bangbang:

Use this firmware at your own risk. Modifying the firmware to a working printer is a bad idea if you don't know exactly what you are doing.
